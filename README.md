# Bridge_and_torch
Scala assignment
There are 2 approaches to the solution that depend on the base conditions
	
	1. maintain the fastest runners at the opposit sides of the bridge;
	   let the slowest pairs cross and 
	    then returne the torch to the other side by one of the 2 fastest runners
	 2. let the fastest runner go back and forth across the bridge and take the rest 
	    to the other side
	 
The result is the minimun of the 2 above
